# laze-1

A collection of automation things. It can:

* [pay the bills](/girbot) [(with sms confirmation code forwarding)](/laze)
* [control the lights](/sonoff)
* [talk using google tts](/raspberry/#tts)
* [raspberry pi stuff](/raspberry)
* [arduino stuff](/arduino)

## Basic setup

You need to have the enviornment variable `LAZE_PATH` configured:

```
export LAZE_PATH="$HOME/laze-1"
```

In this example, I assume you cloned `laze-1` in your `$HOME` directory.
